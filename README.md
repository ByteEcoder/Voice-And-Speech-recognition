# **Voice Recognition and Location Sender Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on implementing a real-time voice recognition system that compares live voice inputs to pre-registered samples, ensuring that only authorized users are recognized. Additionally, the system features a location sender function that sends the current GPS coordinates to a predefined destination when the authorized user is identified. This project is designed for applications requiring secure voice-based access and real-time location tracking.

## **Features**
- **Real-time Voice Recognition**:
  - Captures live voice input and compares it with pre-stored `.wav` files.
  - Uses a machine learning model to ensure high sensitivity and accuracy in identifying authorized voices.
  - Supports multiple reference voice samples for comparison, enhancing flexibility in multi-user environments.

- **Location Sender**:
  - After successful voice recognition, the system sends the device's current GPS coordinates.
  - Location can be sent via SMS, email, or through a web service (configurable).
  - Real-time tracking and logging of location based on voice command.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** for voice recognition and location sending.
- **SpeechRecognition** library for handling voice input and processing.
- **Pydub** or **Librosa** for handling `.wav` files and preprocessing audio.
- **scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** for implementing the machine learning model for voice comparison.
- **Geopy** or **GPS Module** for fetching the device's location.
- **Twilio API / SMTP** for sending GPS coordinates via SMS or email.

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-recognition-location-sender.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Set up your reference voice samples in the `reference_voices` directory.
   
4. Configure the location sender (API keys, email, or SMS credentials) in the `config.py` file.

## **Usage**
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The system will listen for a voice input and compare it with the reference samples.

3. If the voice is recognized, it will fetch the current location and send it to the configured destination.

## **Customization**
- **Voice Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of voice comparison in the configuration section of `main.py` by modifying the machine learning model's threshold.
- **Multiple Users**: Add multiple `.wav` reference files in the `reference_voices` directory for multi-user recognition.
- **Location Sending**: Customize the API or method used for sending GPS data (e.g., SMS, email, or HTTP requests).

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with additional security layers like face recognition or fingerprint sensors.
- Enhancing the machine learning model for more robust voice recognition across varying environments.
- Adding support for different languages in voice recognition.
